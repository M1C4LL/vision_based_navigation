Do once:

# Set up your name (modify):
$ git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"

# Set up your email-adress (modify):
$ git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"

# Set git to use the credential memory cache for storing your password for github (just paste): 
$ git config --global credential.helper cache

# Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds) (just paste):
$ git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'

# Download the complete repository as folder "catkin_ws" into the current folder
$ git clone https://github.com/M1C4LL/vision_based_navigation.git catkin_ws

Remark: it is easiest if you use the repository folder directly as your catkin_ws.
Just relocate your own catkin_ws for a minute, call the upper command to download catkin_ws at your favourite location (e.g. home) and then copy all the additional files you want to have in your catkin_ws into this new catkin_ws. Add all folders and files, which you do not want to get uploaded in the hidden file catkin_ws/.gitignore. So they are ignored during push and pull.


commands for every day use:

# let git detect new files, which you created since your last commit.
$ git add .

# Commit the modifications you made to your local git repository (modify):
git commit -a -m 'COMMENT ABOUT THE MODIFICATIONS (starting lower case, first sentence as a short summary)'

# Upload your modifications to master branch on github (just paste):
$ git push https://github.com/M1C4LL/vision_based_navigation.git master

# go back to current master (revert local changes you made)
$ git checkout master

# go back to current master (revert local changes you made, only one file)
$ git checkout <commit> <file>
